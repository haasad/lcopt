The best way to get started with Lcopt is to explore one of the example models.

First make sure you've set up either ecoinvent or FORWAST as a background database.

.. highlight:: console

Then activate your lcopt environment, and use the command line command `lcopt-launcher` to launch Lcopt ::

	activate lcopt
	cd C:\Users\pjjoyce\Documents\01_Lcopt_models
	lcopt-launcher

This dialog will appear:
